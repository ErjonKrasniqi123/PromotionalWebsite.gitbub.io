     <p> As time continues Apple will continue to get larger and larger, with this rapid growth
        technological advances will come. This includes for example in the words of Tim Cook an
        Ipad feeling more like a Macbook rather than a oversized Iphone. It has also been stated
        that Apple with go into the car manafacturing side of market, creating a new type of 
        technological vehicle thats never been seen before, including better human and AI connections
        which would be of a greated benefit to us in the future. If Apple starts venturing  into
        more markets they may start creating products such as better quality virtual glasses or 
        even hovering images in the near to far future. We would probably start to see some of
        these futuristic products as early as 2024 which is the planned release year of the Apple 
        car. </p>
     
     <h2 style="font-size:3vw"> What it means for us</h2>

        that our lifes in the future will be easier. With technolodgy connectimg us closer and closer

        it will make getting around much easier not making people feel stressed or anything like that 
        when driving. And by having smoother looking technolodgy consumers can get things done quicker
        such as having more useful buttons or better physical feautures.
