       <h1 style="font-size:3vw"> The Founding of Apple</h1> 
    </header>
    <p> Apple first began with Steve Jobs and Steve Wozinack on April 1, 1976 in Cupertino, California. 
        In the begining they worked out of a garage which is not what you picture considering Apple now
        is worth more than $1 trillion dollars. Even though Apple is a major success now it wasn't always
        like it is now. At one point Steve Jobs actually got kicked out of the company, but eventually returned
        when the company was failing and brought it back up. This in turn would be a good choice for both 
        Apple and Steve Jobs. </p>
    
    <h2 style="font-size:3vw"> The Boom that made it all Happen</h2>    
    <p> The start of Apples sucess started in 1984 with the relaes of their first popular product the 
        Macintosh or nowadays known as the Macbook. The only problem at that time was that a Macintosh
        would set you back $2500, which is the equvilent of around $6,267.42.They purchased NeXt a company
        at the time and put it into all of there Macbooks, and eventually used it in the Ipod, Iphone, and Ipad. By releasing
        the Iphone on June 27, 2007 opening the door to a new type of space in the cellphone market and 
        adding touchscreens to that list of cellphones. This original Iphone was listed for $499 USD, this
        was a good price considering fliphones at the time cost arounf the $300 mark. Adding all of these 
        ingredients togetjer it can be seen how Apples has grown as a company.
